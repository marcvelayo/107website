I love Christmas season. It's the holiday that reminds me so much of home. It's more than just a day of gift-giving. It's a holiday that unites everyone back where I was from. The Philippines is a Catholic nation-- so everyone is excited to celebrate the birthday of Jesus. I was born and raised as a Catholic and I believe in Jesus Christ. This symbolizes a lot of things for every Filipino. It symbolizes hope-- that things will get better. It symbolizes love-- which brings family and friends together. It symbolizes the act of generosity-- the act of giving and helping.

When I was a kid, I was always excited on the last week of November. Most Filipinos would start buying Christmas decorations to beautify their homes. My family would put up colorful Christmas lights in front of our house. My mom would usually bring out the Christmas tree, and my brother and I would take turns in decorating it. We also bring out our family's parol that lights up our front yard.

My childhood friends would call me around 6pm to go caroling and we'd sing popular Christmas jingles at the top of our lungs. There are a lot of traditions during the month of December. My family and I would attend the Simbang Gabi, which is a nine-day series of Masses until Christmas Eve. I remember waking up at 3 AM just to attend the masses which I dreaded as a kid. But as I grew up, I realized its importance and how it brought families closer to each other.

My third project-- <b>Barangay Liwanag (Village of Lights) </b>depicts the Filipino tradition of putting up parols. I want to depict the Filipino immigrants who still uphold our culture and traditions, even though they have moved away from home. I've seen houses in the Bay Area decorated with a parol and it reminds me of my roots. It gives me light and joy-- that even though I am in another country, I am still surrounded by family.
